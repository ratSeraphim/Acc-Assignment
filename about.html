            <p>I am the creator of this site, Telma Laudobele. At the time of writing this (12th of January, 2023) I have been studying at LVT for 4 years and am participating in an internship for my final credits.</p>
            <p>Programming is both a passion and the career path I've chosen. Though I am still learning and run into obstacles often, I'm determined to become a great programmer.</p>
            <p>This project is being made for an assignment given by our mentor in the aforementioned internship. As time goes on, the webpage will receive a multitude of updates such as CSS styling and JavaScript functions.</p>
